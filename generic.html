								<h3>Nutritional Hunger.</h3>
								<p>This is the only legitimate hunger, the way your body is showing you that you have not eaten enough nutrients that day. If what you ate was high processed foods, you will be hungry again soon. You can fix this hunger by eating more nutrient-dense foods.</p>


								<hr />

								<h4>Thirst</h4>
								<p>It is possible that when your body is thirsty, you might experience hunger. Our ancestors did not have access to water all the time and took most of the water from fruits and vegetables. If you know that you have not drank enough water during the day and you are hungry, a glass of water should fix it.</p>

							<h4>Variety</h4>
							<p>The body naturally craves variety in the diet to make sure it receives the full range of necessary nutrients. If you feel hungry, try just changing up your menu to see if you feel more
satiated.
</p>
<h4>Low-blood sugar</h4>
<p>The rise and fall of our blood sugar after eating low-quality sugars can also make us feel hungry, even soon after we eat. Avoid low-quality sugars as often as possible and even limit natural sugar sources to avoid a crashing blood sugar level.</p>

<h4>Emotional hunger</h4>
<p>This is one of the most dangerous types of dysfunctional eating, and sadly, it is extremely common today. We connect food with emotions. This behavior is often learnt since we are babies, our parents offered us food or sweets when we were crying and like this our brain understood that this is the way to deal with emotions. <br> We can fix this by recognizing our emotions and try other activities to overcome it.</p>
